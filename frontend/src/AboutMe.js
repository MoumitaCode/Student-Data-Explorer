      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi! My name is Moumita, and I created this app to help people understand data related to English Language Learners (ELL) in schools. As someone who has experienced language barriers firsthand, I understand how important it is to have resources and support when learning a new language. This app aims to shed light on how many students are learning English and what resources are available to help them succeed.
The app features easy-to-read visualizations, such as bar charts and pie charts, that show the number of ELL students and how they are distributed across different states and racial/ethnic groups. My goal is to make this data accessible to educators, students, and anyone interested in better understanding ELL education.
Thanks for checking out my project! If you have any feedback or questions, feel free to reach out.</p>
